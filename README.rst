IcseCtl
=======

IcseCtl is a library to control the ICStation USB multi channel relay
modules (ICSE012A, ICSE013A, ICSE014A).

Initialization
--------------

The initialization of the devices is handled by udev.
To set up udev::

    sudo cp examples/icseudev.py /lib/udev
    sudo cp examples/99-icsectl.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

When a device is plugged in the relays are switched on by default.
After detection the icsudev.py script switches them off.

Symbolic links /dev/ttyICSE012A, /dev/ttyICSE013A, /devttyICSE014A are
created if a respective device is connected. If another PL2303 device
is connected a link /dev/ttyPL2303 is created.

Initialization is logged in the system log.

Permissions
-----------

Per default, only root is allowed to use devices directly.
On Debian and Ubuntu serial USB devices are assigned to group dialout.
To allow a user to use the device call::

    adduser USER dialout

Usage
-----

The script examples/icsectl can be used to switch individual relays.
The status is kept in a file in the user's home directory.
If the file does not yet exist, it is assumed that all relays are switched off.

Caveats
-------

The PL2303 driver may try to bind to the relay card. You can blacklist the
pl2303 module by creating a file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-pl2303.conf with::

    blacklist pl2303
